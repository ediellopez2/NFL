# NFL
Query a database about NFL stats.

Purpose: Design and implement a tiered data management application consisting of an interface for interacting with
the user and a back-end database for storing and retrieving the data. The user should have the capability
to visualize the data in the database, add new data, delete, and update existing data. Extracting statistics
and reports from the database is a feature that you should also consider.

Getting Started:
Step 1: Install node.js on your machine.
Step 2: From Visual Studio Code, open the directory were you have these files.
Step 3: From the Terminal in Visual Studio Code, run ...
npm init
npm install sqlite3
npm install express
npm install bluebird
Step 4: You now have the necessary packages to run server.js. From the Terminal in Visual Studio Code, run ...
node server ('node server.js' works too!)
Step 5: Open 'computers.html' on your browser.
